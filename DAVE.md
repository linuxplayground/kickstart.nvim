# Instructions for this kickstart

These are my personal instructions for things that have to be done in addition
to this kickstart to get neovim working as I want.

- `sudo apt install ripgrep`
- `git clone https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig ~/.config/nvim/pack/nvim/start/nvim-lspconfig`
- Mason: Install these plugins
  - ansible-language-server ansiblels

  - markdownlint-cli2
  - stylua
